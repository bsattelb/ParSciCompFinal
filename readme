running 'make' will create executables for the 
	Sequential program	- fullySequential
	MPI Encryption    	- MPIencryption
	MPI 3DES Encryption	- MPI3DES
	MPI Brute Force    	- bruteParallel
	OpenMP Brute Force 	- openMPbruteForce

The gnu compiler g++ is used for non-MPI programs (with the -fopenmp flag for openmp).
MPI programs use mpicxx.

Slurm files exist to run MPIencryption, bruteParallel, and openMPbruteForce on Mio.

bruteForce reads from "encrypted.txt" and searches for the string 'aaaaaaaa'
openMPbruteForce works equivalently
MPIencryption encrypts from input.png to output.txt
	Changing from encryption to decryption is changed by changing a global variable
	Input and output files are similarly changed
MPI3DES works the same as MPIencryption

encrypted.txt and input.txt are attatched
